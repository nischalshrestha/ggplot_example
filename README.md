# ggplot_example

Example of ggplot tasks using the learnr package for experiments. 

The `learnr` essentially allows one to create a Shiny app either:
1) Locally on the computer via RStudio 'Run Document' command on the [ggplot.Rmd](https://github.com/nischalshrestha/ggplot_example/blob/master/ggplot/ggplot.Rmd) file, or
2) On a server like shinyserver.io: https://nshrest.shinyapps.io/ggplot_tasks/

The first option is the least riskiest as it doesn't rely on shinyservers being stable etc.

# Dependencies:

You need RStudio (v1.0.136 or later) and the following R packages:

- ggplot2
- knitr
- learnr
- shiny
- gradethis (current not being used much)

All of these can be installed via `install.packages(...)` command.
